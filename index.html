<p>This game can be played online during a Zoom meeting or other group activity. Individual players can get a card in order to participate. The host goes to the Bingo Board to randomly draw numbers. As the host calls out the numbers, players can click or tap their board when numbers match. When a player completes a row across, down or diagonally, they shout out "BINGO!" and that round ends.</p>
