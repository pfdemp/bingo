<p>Bingo is usually a very social activity played in a crowded church basement or camp dining hall. During our current stay-at-home lifestyle, large gatherings like this will be prohibited. To deal with the burning need for a way to play bingo while maintaining appropriate distance, we present "Socially Distant Bingo."</p>
<p>This game can be played online during a Zoom meeting or other group activity. Players will need to have a browser window open during the meeting and will click on &ldquo;Get your Bingo card.&rdquo; The host shares their screen so everyone can see the Bingo Board.</p>
<p>Once everyone is set, the host starts calling numbers. Players click on the square on their board when they get a match. Once a player completes a row  across, down or diagonally, they shout out &ldquo;Bingo!&rdquo; and revel in the frustrated  groans of their fellow players.</p>
